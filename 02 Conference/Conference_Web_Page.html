	<h1><b>2016 International Leadership Conference</b></h1>
	<h2>Thursday, October 13th, 2016</h2>
	<!--This is the description of the conference.-->
	<p>How should organizations manage the uncertain and challenging world that confronts us here and abroad? Leaders have a special challenge in setting the direction of their organizations and understanding the implications of that direction for all their stakeholders, including the coming generation of leaders. Drawing on the experience of people who have led in the private sector, in public service, or at non-profit organizations, our annual conferences seek to identify the personal and organizational capacities that leaders will need and the steps that organizations can best take to build these capacities throughout the enterprise.

		The annual International Leadership Conference is one of the gatherings most popular with, and most beneficial for, corporate leaders, according to Weber Shandwickâ€™s 2011 (fifth annual) ranking of  Five-Star Executive Conferences. An article by Forbes.com writer Matthew Kirdahy on the report notes that the International Leadership Conference is second only to the Fortune Innovation/iMeme conference in the number of C-level speaker participants. And in a another study by Burson-Marsteller, the conference was named as one of the "Most Valued Podiums" for CEOs and senior executives.</p>
